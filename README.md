# Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood

## By Mike Wilkes

#### A web form that treats some digits like bad words and changes them to friendly words.
The form returns a list of values from 0 to the user's inputted number:
* Numbers without a 1, 2, or 3 digit are unchanged. 
* If the number has a 1, it is replaced with **"Beep!"**.
* If the number has a 2 (and no 1), it is replaced with **"Boop!"**.
* If the number has a 3 (and no 2 or 1), it is replaced with **"Won't you be my neighbor?"**.
